% - Curlie = community edited web directory -> 3M websites in 92 languages,
% labeled in hierarchical categories, however they only used the top level categories
% Originally, there were 15 top level categories, but they dropped "Regional"
% - Majority of classes associated with Bussiness (27), Society (13.9) or Arts (9)
% - 40% of the websites are in English, 16 % in German, 5% in french, 6% in Japanese
% - Although each page may, in principle, have an arbitrary number of category labels, 
% at the top level, the data is mostly single-labeled, with only 2.1% of samples appearing 
% in two or more taxonomy trees of the 14 top-level classes.


\section{Data}
In our work, we utilise the crowdsourced annotated Curlie data provided by the authors of Homepage2vec \cite{homepage2vec}. 
This dataset consists of 800 websites, each annotated with 1-3 labels from the 14 top-level categories of the Curlie web directory.
