A significant difficulty in website topic classification is the scarcity of extensive, high-quality open source datasets. The subjective nature of multilabel website classification often leads to ambiguous ground truths, as evidenced by the low inter-annotator agreement scores observed within the \texttt{crowdsourced} dataset. To enhance model learning and performance, the development of more precise and narrowly defined category scopes is essential.

Further enhancements in labeling accuracy and model performance could be achieved through additional experimentation with the instructional prompt. 
Providing the model with a greater number of examples or employing repeated prompting to simulate an ensemble approach may prove beneficial.
