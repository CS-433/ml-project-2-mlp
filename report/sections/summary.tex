\section{Summary}\label{sec:summary}

We have demonstrated that LLMs can provide consistent, cost-effective, and high-quality annotations for the complex task of multi-lingual, multi-label website topic classification.
Our approach, which involved fine-tuning a pre-trained Homepage2vec model with the \texttt{curlie-3.5-10k} labels, resulted in a improvement of 9\% in the Macro F1 score. 
This can be attributed to the fact that the new dataset better captures the distribution of website topics.
Additionally, we are releasing the \texttt{curlie-3.5-10k} and \texttt{curlie-4-10k} datasets with the intention of supporting further research and development in the open-source community.
