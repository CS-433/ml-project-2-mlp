\section{Summary}\label{sec:summary}

We have demonstrated that LLMs can provide consistent, cost-effective, and high-quality annotations for the complex task of multilingual, multilabel website topic classification. Our approach, which involved finetuning a pre-trained Homepage2vec model on LLM-generated labels, resulted in a improvement of 3.6 percentage points in the macro F1 score. Additionally, we are releasing the \texttt{curlie-gpt3.5-10k} and \texttt{curlie-gpt4-10k} datasets with the intention of supporting further research in the open-source community.
