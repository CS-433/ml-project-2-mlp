\section{Ethical Considerations}\label{sec:ethical-considerations}
This study employs the Curlie dataset, managed by dedicated volunteers and moderators ensuring its content remains legal and free from marketing schemes. 
Additionally, the \texttt{crowdsourced} dataset, created by Amazon Mechanical Turk workers, was used. 
These workers were compensated following ethical standards referenced in \cite{ethics1, ethics2, homepage2vec}.



Notably, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for annotation, while efficient, raises concerns about the economic impact on human annotators who rely on such tasks for income. 
Moreover, the extensive datasets training LLMs may contain biases, potentially influencing the labeling process and perpetuating stereotypes or inequalities. 
It's essential to address these biases to maintain fairness and uphold ethical standards in automated systems.
