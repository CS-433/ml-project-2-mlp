\section{Methods}\label{sec:methods}
The overall goal of our work is to improve mutlilabel classification performance of the original homepage2vec model \cite{homepage2vec}. We refer to this model as \texttt{baseline}. First, we finetune and evaluate the baseline on the original crowdsourced. Second, since the crowdsourced dataset is relatively small, we come up with a new labeling method which will then allow us to annotate the curlie-gpt-10k dataset. Third, we finetune the baseline on the new dataset and evaluate on the human annotated orignal dataset.  Each of these steps is detailed below.
