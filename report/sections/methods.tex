% Mention the overall goal of our work to keep the big picture in mind
The overall goal of our work is to improve mutlilabel classification performance of the original homepage2vec model \cite{homepage2vec}. We refer to this model as \texttt{baseline}. 

% 1. Step: Show that we can create high-quality annotations (measured against human annotations)
% - introduce curlie (talk about features (missing values), embedding, label list_ , re-scrape + process + embeddin
% ---> All this is pretty much in data, so transfer it here


% - introduce labelers (parameter dimensions), introduce prompt, one shot example:
\textbf{Getting Optimal Labeler.} % TODO: describe the process of getting the optimal labeler using the table below.

\input{tables/labelers_setup}


% 2. Step: Show that we can improve performance compared to pre-trained model via fine-tuning with GPT annotations
% - training parameters (hparams, train/ test data splits)
% - evaluation procedure (macro f1, â€¦)
% - calibration (?)
