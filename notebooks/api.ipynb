It was time to record so I went to the studio and released all the energy that I had built up over two years touring performing recording with the greats. When I was finished with the record, We were trying to figure out the title of the album, DRE saw the tattoo on the back of my neck and it said “Restless”, he said that’s what you should call the album. Mr Cartoon did that tattoo, little did I know it would turn out to be the title of a life altering experience. 20 years ago this album came out and changed my life. Thank you for the love, thank you for the support. I’m glad you guys enjoyed it as much as I did making it.” Check out the Restless 20th Anniversary website at: Restless20.com Xzibit, B-Real, & Demrick Drop New Serial Killers Album “Summer Of Sam” Posted on October 17, 2020 News Leave a comment The Serial Killers collective, made up of Xzibit, B-Real, and Demrick, have come through with their new album “Summer Of Sam.” It’s October, which means it’s about that time for some new music from the Serial Killers collective. Following up on their recent effort Day Of The Dead, Xzibit, B-Real, and Demrick have once again joined forces for a new effort, this one bigger and better than before. Locking in with several Aftermath alumni behind the boards, including longtime Dr. Dre collaborators Focus and Dem Jointz, Summer Of Sam comes equipped with some hard-hitting production. And though the group’s name may suggest something closer to horrorcore, their latest effort is far more insightful, drawing inspiration from the current state of the world. Song titles like “Triggered,” “Quarantine,” and “War In The Streets” tend to hit rather close to home in the wake of everything that’s been going on.\n",
