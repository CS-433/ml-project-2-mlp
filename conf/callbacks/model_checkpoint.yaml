  dirpath: null # directory to save the model file
  filename: null # checkpoint filename
  monitor: "val/f1" # which metric to monitor
  mode: "max" # "max" means higher metric value is better, can be also "min"
  verbose: True # verbosity mode

  save_weights_only: True # if True, then only the modelâ€™s weights will be saved
  every_n_train_steps: null # number of training steps between checkpoints
  train_time_interval: null # checkpoints are monitored at the specified time interval
  every_n_epochs: null # number of epochs between checkpoints
  save_on_train_epoch_end: null # whether to run checkpointing at the end of the training epoch or the end of validation
